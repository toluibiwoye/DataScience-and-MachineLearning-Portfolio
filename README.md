Introduction
PERSONAL INTRODUCTION:  
My passion for data first started with football, particularly with the club I support Arsenal. I concluded that data would help me better understand the game in terms of tactics, strategies and player actions. During my data engineering internship at Sunlife, this made much more sense and helped bring my ideas to life. I didn’t know what to expect going in, but it made me fall head over heels for data work.

Looking ahead, I hope to work with data, perhaps for a football team. Whether I am working with a football team or by myself, I always give it my all. I’m always willing to learn more and delve deeper. 

What makes me unique? Data are stories to me. Every piece of data tells us something different, just like every dish has a unique tale to tell. I think data can link people together and make things plain, much like a meal can.

Arsene Wenger, the legendary arsenal manager once said “The biggest things in life have been achieved by people who, at the start we would’ve judged crazy” I am confident that I am headed towards accomplishing something truly spectacular in the field of data due to my passion and perseverance.

Project Section:
1. Collibra Implementation at Sunlife
Brief Description:
Development and implementation of the Collibra tool, which enables easy data transfer between Sunlife's departments. The project aims to improve report providing procedures while improving immediate data accessibility.
Infrastructure:
•	Data Storage: Multiple company databases.
•	Platform: Sunlife's internal data platform.
Tools & Technologies Used:
•	Data-related tool: Collibra
•	Programming & Scripting: SQL for reverse engineering stored procedures.
•	Data Import/Export: Excel for data transformation before Collibra import.
2. QA Testing Across Environments at Sunlife
Brief Description:
Quality Assurance (QA) testing that ensures data accuracy and consistency across various platforms. The project ensures easy data flow from development stages to production.
Infrastructure:
•	Data Storage: Sunlife's internal databases (Development, QA, Staging, and Production).
•	Platform: Sunlife's internal testing platform.
Tools & Technologies Used:
•	Data-related tools: Internal QA tools.
•	Environment Management: Tools for switching and comparing between Dev, QA, Staging, and Production.
3. Predicting Football Player Performance Using Historical Data (To be confirmed)

Brief Description:
The goal of the analysis is to predict football players' most likely performance in upcoming games or the upcoming season using their past season statistics. The intention is to help fantasy football participants choose their teams based on data-driven selections. 
What will it look like?
It will have a header image, which will probably be a footballer accompanied by charts and graphs. An introduction that will talk about the importance of predicting a player’s performance. Why is it important to predict player performances? The role of data in football, how it can aid strategies in terms of injury management, training, and the transfer market. Data collection will also be a feature, where am I getting the data from? The challenges and limitations of data collection. Data Preprocessing, Cleaning and structuring the data. Results, how well did we do? Model predictions vs actual results. Accuracy, precision, recall. Conclusion and references
Infrastructure:
•	Data Storage: Local CSV files initially, with potential to migrate to cloud storage.
•	Software/Platform: Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model development.
Tools & Technologies Used:
•	Data Processing: Python, 
•	Machine Learning Framework: Scikit-learn.
•	Data Visualization: Tableau
Data Visualization:
Visual presentations of:
Player statistics over seasons (e.g., goals scored, assists, minutes played)
Model's performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
Results:
I will use linear regression to implement my results one I have implemented my project.
