PERSONAL INTRODUCTION:  
My passion for data first started with football, particularly with the club I support Arsenal. I concluded that data would help me better understand the game in terms of tactics, strategies, and player actions. During my data engineering internship at Sunlife, this made much more sense and helped bring my ideas to life. I didn’t know what to expect going in, but it made me fall head over heels for data work.
