## Introduction

My passion for data first started with basketball, particularly with the club I support Arsenal. I concluded that data would help me better understand the game in terms of tactics, strategies and player actions. During my data engineering internship at Sunlife, this made much more sense and helped bring my ideas to life. I didn’t know what to expect going in, but it made me fall head over heels for data work.

Looking ahead, I hope to work with data, perhaps for a basketball team. Whether I am working with a basketball team or by myself, I always give it my all. I’m always willing to learn more and delve deeper. 

What makes me unique? Data are stories to me. Every piece of data tells us something different, just like every dish has a unique tale to tell. I think data can link people together and make things plain, much like a meal can.

Arsene Wenger, the legendary arsenal manager once said “The biggest things in life have been achieved by people who, at the start we would’ve judged crazy” I am confident that I am headed towards accomplishing something truly spectacular in the field of data due to my passion and perseverance.

### Comparing different Basketball Player Eras Using Historical Data 

![Lebron vs MJ](https://github.com/toluibiwoye/DataScience-and-MachineLearning-Portfolio/assets/72495445/2010a398-cb7c-4abd-a707-b157650c970d)

The LeBron vs. Jordan debate is longstanding in basketball circles. However, based on our graph comparing Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Field Goal percentage (FG%), LeBron emerges as the more efficient player. This data adds a new dimension to the discussion about who truly is the GOAT in basketball.
